The goal of this game is to kill any monster you encounter to
gain experience and level up. For each level you get stronger
and can eventually kill the final boss. During game play it
is possible to collect new weapons, potions, keys and trea-
sures.

When you enter game you are in the starting room and your only
equipment is a club. Use the keys display in the navigation
menu to move between the rooms. Beware that some rooms are 
guarded by monsters. If a room is locked you need to open it
with a key found in various rooms. 

Each treasure found is worth a various amount of points. The
more points you have when killing the boss the higher score 
you will get. The game is completed when the boss dies.
For every monster you kill 20 points are added to your score.
For every movement turn you get minus 5 points to the score.
